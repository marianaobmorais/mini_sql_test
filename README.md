# Mini SQL test for UENI

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

Firstly, I would like to thank you for considering me for the Junior Data Analyst position at UENI.

## Here's what I did...

I decided to share the SQL code through a **private repository** on GitHub as it allows for a better readability.

However, before importing the datasets into PgAdmin4 (PostgreSQL), I did some cleaning of the data on Excel:
- Changed the date format from dd/mm/yyyy to **yyyy-mm-dd** as it is accepted by PostgreSQL;
- and replaced the commas (,) to **period points (.)** in the **NUMERIC** values.
  
Next, I created the database on PgAdmin4 and its datasets where I determined the data types, so it would be imported correctly.
After these steps, I proceeded to analyse the datasets as it follows [here](https://github.com/marianaobmorais/test_ueni/blob/main/mini_sql_test_ueni.sql).
